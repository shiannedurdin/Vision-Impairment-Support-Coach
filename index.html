        <h2 id="desc-heading">Description</h2>
        <p>As a child, I was fortunate to have attended a blind school where I received support in various aspects of life with low vision such as assistive technology, braille courses and adaptive sports, however, I always lacked the comfort of having people I could talk to, who had the lived experience of a blind or low vision individual. And that is why as a support coach for the vision impaired, I not only offer personalised braille and screen reader training, tailored advice on pathways for the future, and strategies for a more independent daily life, I also offer mentorship. A space of understanding. A place where each and every one of my clients feels heard and validated. Because while blindness might mean lack of sight, it does not mean lack of vision. Online platform Zoom will be used for all appointments and programs.</p>
