    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      As a child, I was fortunate to have attended a blind school where I received support in various aspects of life with low vision such as assistive technology, braille courses and adaptive sports, however, I always lacked the comfort of having people I could talk to, who had the lived experience of a blind or low vision individual. And that is why as a support coach for the vision impaired, I not only offer personalised braille and screen reader training, tailored advice on pathways for the future, and strategies for a more independent daily life, I also offer mentorship. A space of understanding. A place where each and every one of my clients feels heard and validated. Because while blindness might mean lack of sight, it does not mean lack of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online platform Zoom will be used for all appointments and programs, all of which are designed to cater to blind and low vision individuals, as well as parents and allies.
